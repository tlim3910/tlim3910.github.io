          Learning physics is very much like building a house of cards (as the great Richard Feynman has once
          said). If any of the cards are forgotten or set on an unsturdy base, the whole thing collapses. For this
          reason, physics can be considered a difficult subject, or rather time-consuming. To build a strong
          foundation, you have to learn various topics of physics and tie the ideas together so they remain strong. 
          And this process requires a lot of practice, time, and most importantly ... fun!

          This website consists of a lot of creative physics problems and puzzles developed by some amazing physics mentors.
          In addition to their brilliance, I try to sneak some of my own ideas in. I have also created figures for each problem so students can enjoy them more.
          Lastly, the questions are designed so that anyone who has studied intro physics can enjoy. 
          Physics is everywhere, and real world examples are highly available
          around us.

          Oh, by the way, physics aside means put <a class="underline"> physics aside</a> and bring in <a class="underline"> fun</a>
