        Learning physics is very much like building a house of cards (as the great Richard Feynman has once
        said). If any of the cards are forgotten or set on an unsturdy base, the whole thing collapses. For this
        reason, physics can be considered a difficult subject, or rather time-consuming. To build a strong
        foundation, you have to learn various topics of physics and tie the ideas together so they remain strong. 
        And this process requires a lot of practice, time, and most importantly ... fun!

        The website consist of a lot of creative physics problems and puzzles developed by some amazing physics mentors.
        In addition to their brilliance, I tried to sneak some of my own in. Fair warning though, they might seem a little scattered 
        here and there as they grow from just some fun thoughts in my head. The questions are designed so that anyone who has studied 
        intro physics can enjoy. Physics is everywhere, and real world examples are highly available
        around us.

        Oh, by the way, physics aside means put <a class="underline"> physics aside</a> and bring in <a class="underline"> fun</a>
